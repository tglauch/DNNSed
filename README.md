The spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars consinsts in an ideal case of two bumps where the first bump is due to synchroton emission of accelerated particles in the jet. Hence the position of the first bump, the nu-peak, provides important information about the nature and the energetics of the object. In most real world examples fitting the nu-peak is somewhat challenging due to sparse data and the background emission of the galaxy. This project provides an easy to use deep-learning based nu-peak estimator that has several advantages

- *Automatized* prediction of the nu-peak in less than 1 second per source (even on a CPU)
- *Stability* against sparse data and background emission
- *Reliable* error estimation
